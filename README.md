App that lets you upload social media links to share with friends and followers. Lets you create a custom link to add to your bio, or to send to all of your friends!!!

## Link Tree Clone
This app is intended to showcase my skills at creating popular existing applications, websites, services, and platforms in this case it's a linktree clone! The popular website
for influencers and creators to add all of there social media links in one place, usually to put on there bio, descriptions, advertisements, and much much much more!!!

## Challenge

How fast can I build this app? I am challenging myself to build this app as fast as possible, while also tryting to solve coding scenerios that appear in different ways than what I am used to.
I will be streaming all of this on twitch, and also I'll be posting time stamps below detailing what I did and how long it took me to solve it!!!

### 07.11.23 - 07.12.23
2:32 Hours / Minutes: I created the project, set up a chart diagram to detail what I'll be doing today, downloaded all the required libraries, and created the home screen / user start page.

Thank you very much!!! If you're interested star my project, or follow me on twitch to watch me live code this, and other projects as well!!!
